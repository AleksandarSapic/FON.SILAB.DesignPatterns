# Design Patterns

This is a school project where I cover 20 out of 23 design patterns based on the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by the Gang of Four. 
Each pattern is a project on its own, and within each of them, a document in the src folder explains the request for that specific use of the pattern.

## Getting started

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Set up the MySQL database using the SQL script provided in *<pattern_folder>/src/MySQLDatabase*.
> For every design pattern, except the State pattern (STAP), the SQL schema is the same. So basically, it is only necessary to import the AFP script and the STAP script.
- Rename example configuration file in every pattern project.
> `config.example.properties` -> `config.properties`

> Then configure it with your database connection details.
- Open the project in a Java IDE; this project was developed in NetBeans.
- Build and run the project.
